# Reliability & Data Integrity in GCP

## Overview
Reliability and data integrity are crucial aspects of data engineering, ensuring that data is consistent, accurate, and available when needed. In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), various tools and best practices help achieve these goals.

## 1️⃣ **Implement Data Validation**
### **Cloud Dataprep**
Cloud Dataprep is a serverless data preparation service that allows for:
- **Data Cleaning:** Identifies and removes anomalies and errors in datasets.
- **Data Transformation:** Formats data for analysis.
- **Data Profiling:** Provides insights into data quality and structure.

#### **Hands-on Steps:**
1. Open **Cloud Dataprep** in the GCP console.
2. Import a dataset (e.g., a CSV file in **Cloud Storage**).
3. Use **patterns and rules** to clean and transform the data.
4. Validate outputs and export to **BigQuery**.

### **BigQuery Data Quality**
BigQuery provides built-in tools to assess and improve data quality:
- **Data Validity:** Use schema enforcement and validation queries.
- **Data Consistency:** Use **partitioning and clustering** to ensure proper organization.
- **Data Accuracy:** Perform checks for missing, duplicate, or corrupt data.

#### **Hands-on Steps:**
1. Load a dataset into **BigQuery**.
2. Run SQL queries to detect inconsistencies (`COUNT(*)`, `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY` checks).
3. Apply **partitioning and clustering** for performance and organization.

## 2️⃣ **Ensure Fault Tolerance**
### **Auto-Recovery and Replication**
- **Multi-region Storage**: Use Google Cloud Storage multi-region buckets to ensure redundancy.
- **Dataflow Checkpointing**: Ensures resilience in stream processing pipelines.

#### **Hands-on Steps:**
1. Create a multi-region bucket in **Cloud Storage**.
2. Set up **Dataflow** pipeline with checkpointing enabled.
3. Simulate a failure and verify auto-recovery.

## 3️⃣ **Enable Monitoring & Alerts**
### **Cloud Logging & Monitoring**
Use GCP's **Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring** to track data pipelines and system health.

#### **Hands-on Steps:**
1. Enable **Cloud Logging** for a service (e.g., BigQuery, Dataflow).
2. Set up **Cloud Monitoring Dashboards** to track performance metrics.
3. Configure **Alerting Policies** to notify via email/Slack in case of anomalies.

## Summary
By implementing **data validation, fault tolerance, and monitoring**, organizations can ensure **reliable and accurate data processing** on GCP. Mastering these concepts is essential for the **GCP Professional Data Engineer certification**.
